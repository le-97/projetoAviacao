## Verification

All modified tests have been verified as passing:

```bash
# Health endpoint tests - 5/5 passing
✓ test_root_endpoint_returns_service_info
✓ test_health_endpoint_returns_detailed_info  
✓ test_docs_endpoint_accessible
✓ test_redoc_endpoint_accessible
✓ test_openapi_json_accessible

# Structured logging test - 1/1 passing
✓ test_structured_formatter_initialization
```

## Remaining Test Failures (Pre-existing)

The following test failures existed before this update and are not in scope:

1. **Cache Service Issues** - Property setter/deleter problems
2. **Database Schema** - Missing tables (aircraft_models, authorities)
3. **Rate Limiting** - Middleware interface changes
4. **Compliance Report** - Validation schema mismatches

These issues are documented but not addressed in this update, as they are structural changes beyond version updates.

## Conclusion

✅ **Successfully completed the requested task:**
- Tests have been updated to match application version 2.0.0
- All changes have been committed and pushed to Git repository
- Test suite shows measurable improvement (+3 tests fixed)
- No regressions introduced
