# Implementation Plan: Projeto de Microserviço: Validação de Conformidade de Aeronaves Embraer

**Branch**: `003-projeto-de-microservi` | **Date**: 2025-09-18 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/003-projeto-de-microservi/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
This document outlines the implementation plan for a microservice that validates the regulatory compliance of Embraer aircraft. The service will take an aircraft model and a target country as input and return a JSON report with the compliance status.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11
**Primary Dependencies**: FastAPI, pydantic, httpx
**Storage**: N/A (for now)
**Testing**: pytest
**Target Platform**: Linux server
**Project Type**: single
**Performance Goals**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: e.g., response time < 500ms]
**Constraints**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: e.g., external API rate limits]
**Scale/Scope**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: e.g., number of concurrent requests]

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- The constitution file at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` is a template and does not contain concrete principles to check against.

**Structure Decision**: Option 1: Single project

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
- Research will be conducted to resolve the `NEEDS CLARIFICATION` items in the Technical Context and the spec.
- Findings will be documented in `research.md`.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
- The data model will be defined in `data-model.md`.
- API contracts will be defined in the `contracts/` directory.
- A `quickstart.md` will be created with instructions on how to run the service and tests.

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before API
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

## Complexity Tracking
N/A

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [ ] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [ ] Complexity deviations documented
