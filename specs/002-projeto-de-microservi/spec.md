# Feature Specification: Projeto de Microservi√ßo: Valida√ß√£o de Conformidade de Aeronaves Embraer

**Feature Branch**: `002-projeto-de-microservi`  
**Created**: 2025-09-18  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Projeto de Microservi√ßo: Valida√ß√£o de Conformidade de Aeronaves Embraer"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user (e.g., an aviation professional, a student), I want to check the regulatory compliance of a specific Embraer aircraft model in both Brazil and a target country for commercialization, so that I can quickly understand its operational readiness and any pending legal requirements.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have selected the "Embraer E190" model and the countries "Brazil" and "USA", **When** I request the compliance check, **Then** the system should return a JSON report showing the compliance status for both countries, including any pending Airworthiness Directives for the USA.
2. **Given** I have selected the "Embraer E195" model and the countries "Brazil" and "Europe", **When** I request the compliance check, **Then** the system should return a JSON report showing the compliance status for both countries, based on ANAC and EASA regulations.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an invalid aircraft model is provided? The system should return an error.
- What happens when a country with no available regulatory data is selected? The system should return a message indicating that the data is not available.
- How does the system handle updates to regulations? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How will the system be updated with the latest regulations from ANAC, FAA, and EASA? Is it a manual or automated process?]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST allow a user to specify an Embraer aircraft model for a compliance check.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST allow a user to specify a country of manufacture (Brazil) and a target country for commercialization.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST validate the compliance of the selected aircraft against the regulations of the specified countries (ANAC for Brazil, FAA for USA, EASA for Europe).
- **FR-004**: The system MUST return a JSON report detailing the compliance status for each country.
- **FR-005**: The report MUST include information on pending requirements or divergences between legislations.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST support at least the Embraer E190 and E195 models.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST provide data for at least Brazil, the USA, and Europe (EASA).

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Aircraft**: Represents an Embraer aircraft model (e.g., E190, E195). Attributes: model name.
- **Regulation**: Represents a regulatory rule from an aviation authority (ANAC, FAA, EASA). Attributes: authority, description, applicability (e.g., specific aircraft model).
- **ComplianceReport**: Represents the output of a compliance check. Attributes: aircraft model, countries, compliance status for each country, list of pending requirements.
